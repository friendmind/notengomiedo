            <p> 
                Prior to meeting you, I had a period of isolation that caused me some issues. One of those issues was the habit of self-sabotaging 
                relationships and situations. I suppose I trained my mind to mess things up
                for myself before getting the chance to explore the uncertain future and from hurting myself or others. 
                I'm sure it's a mix of so many things but I am not very good at fighting against the urge of pulling away and disappearing from people's lives. 
                I am working on it but sometimes it comes through and makes an appearance. 

                <br><br>Unlike you, I have been selfish for most of my life. I have for the most part put myself first. My priority has 
                always been me. Because it I wasn't okay, nothing else in my life would be. Of course, I am careful with what 
                I do and say as I am aware of the impact these things have. But there are times when my emotions take over and 
                I simply do things that hurt others and/or myself. But unlike most people, I am fully aware of what I do and don't do. 
                <br><br>
                So yes, I was aware of the intentions my words had when I sent those texts. They were
                misinterpreted, which I did not see coming. But that is besides the point. You were going through
                it and I projected my fears and worries onto you. So your reaction was valid.

                In difference to you, I don't have an abundance of friends. I enjoy talking to 
                people but I do not let people in which in turn causes friendships to not go anywhere.
                How I mentioned above, I was isolated for a while. During this period, I distanced myself from 
                people, in general, for my own good and for their own good. With time, things have begun to 
                change for me. You know a bit regarding that. It is rare for me to let myself get close to anyone. 
                But when it does occur, I end up having this profound intensity of cherishment for them that can be good and bad.

                *Since I said this was going to be short and concise, I'll stop here. I don't want to go on a tangent and overflood you with information.

                I know this not a full on get to know me website but I say this leaves room for conversation. That is if you want to have it.
                With all that said, I leave you with a small note.
            </p>
