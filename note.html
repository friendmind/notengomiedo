            <br>
            I hope you are doing well. I hope people are taking care of you. I hope you 
            are taking care of yourself. If you don't reach out to me I understand. I am not 
            expecting anything from you. I have been out of the loop and I understand if you 
            do not want to bring me back into it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I really have no clue where I stand in your life and I am doing my best to 
            not be sucked into that not knowing. For all I know I am overthinking things
            and making things far more difficult. But again, who knows. 
            <br><br>
            I don't want to ramble and say things to overcompensate for my emotions and thoughts so I'll end with this.
            I have enjoyed talking to you and enjoyed the time spent with you. I hope to continue 
            our friendship and hope you can help navigate me with this because I am bad at it&#129402; 
            <br><br>
            Also, I hope you liked the website because I had a blast making it.
